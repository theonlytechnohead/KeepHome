# KeepHome

Tired of missing delivered packages? Don't want them exposed in the open? That's what KeepHome can do, with the KeepBox

It's a smart parcelbox, that will safely store delivered parcels and letters, and notify you of them

## KeepHome
KeepHome is an Android app that interfaces with the KeepHome unit, which communicates on to the KeepBox itself

### How to use/install?
There isn't a stable release yet, but you can clone the repo and test it out in Android Studio if you are suitably minded

## KeepHome unit? KeepBox?
The other two parts of this project are found elsewhere:
- [KeepHome](https://github.com/theonlytechnohead/LoRa_KeepHome)
